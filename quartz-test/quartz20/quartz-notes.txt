>>> JobStoreSupport has two types of getConnection(), one managed, and one is non-managed.
* The non-managed conn is used in acquireNextTriggers() and triggersFired(), which are used only in QuartzSchedulerThread#run().
* When using JobStoreTX, the single DS will be used for both types of conn.
* When using JobStoreCMT, it requires two DS setup, one XA DS, and one Non-XA DS (non-managed).
* The managed conn (DS) are used by any other Scheduler methods that manage the job data (schedule, addJob, etc).
  See JobStoreSupport#executeInLock
* There are many read-only conn methods that do not require locks from the managed conn.
  See JobStoreSupport#executeWithoutLock
